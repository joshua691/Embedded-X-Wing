# Embedded X-Wing

A cardboard model of the X-Wing from *Star Wars*, including integrated embedded system components and 3D-printed parts. this project demonstrates embedded programming, embedded model design, and CAD modeling with Fusion 360.

## Overview
This project includes:
- Designing and fabricating custom 3D-printed hinges in Fusion 360 for motorized wing movemet
- Prototyping and testing embedded circuitry on breadboard for power delivery and interfacing
- Programming ESP32 and Arduino microcontrollers to control motors, sensors, and an OLED display

## Features
- Current:
-- 4 custom hinges designed and printed in Fusion 360
-- Breadboard circuits tested for motor power delivery
-- Structural integration with motors for automated wing actuation
- Planned:
-- Object sensing using sensors connected to ESP32
-- OLED display for system feedback and status
-- Expanded embedded features for interactive flight simulation

## Tools & Technologies
- **Hardware:** ESP32, Arduino, embedded components (motors, sensors, OLED display), 3D-printed hinges
- **Software:** Fusion 360, Arduino IDE, C++
- **Other:** Breadboard prototyping

## Results
- Strengthened cardboard frame with 3D-printed hinges and mounted motors
- Enabled automated wing movement
- Created modular design ready for integration of sensors and interactive features
